# Simple user management system
This is a simplified version of a service that allows users to authenticate. The idea is that students understand the general concepts behind sign-up, log-in and user creation and management. Developed using:
- node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

## Assignment
You, as a student, are suposed to do the following:
- Create a API using the stack before that will allow the API clients (your users) to perform the following operations:
    - Sign up: User creation
    - Log in: Enter the application using the user credentials

### Use cases
- As a user of the API, I want to signup (create a new user) with my user name, email and password.
- As a user of the API, I want to login with the email and password and get redirected to the home page of the application where I will see my user name.

### Guidelines
- Thing about the database structure. What information are you going to need from the users?
    - Which table(s) are you going to need?
    - What columns are you going to need?
- Once a user has been created (signup), What would the API response be?
- Once a user has logged in (using his/her email and password), What would the API response be?
- Try to do the assignment by yourself. It is the best way to learn.
- If blocked, check this repository and try to understand. Avoid copy-pasting code ðŸ™‚.
